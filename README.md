#  FarmAI – Smart Farming Assistant

FarmAI is a web-based platform built to help Indian farmers get reliable farming support in one place. The main idea is to combine day-to-day farming needs such as weather alerts, crop disease detection, market prices, and advisory information in a simple and easy-to-use interface.

Many digital tools exist today, but farmers often struggle with complicated apps or English-only interfaces. FarmAI tries to solve this by offering a clean design, multiple languages, and helpful features backed by AI and real-time data.
